# Follow stops and portfolio risk through a backtest

This run uses two synthetic unit-multiplier assets, A and B, with $2,500
starting cash and no fees. Both orders are placed on January 2 and filled at
$100 on January 3. B has a 5% stop loss. A has no position stop, so it remains
available for a portfolio drawdown rule that halves exposure after a 10%
drawdown. All bars are daily; the declared open, high, low, and close are equal,
so the $94 B exit is an observable gap below its $95 stop level. The run uses
default next-bar order timing.

## Run the strategy

`ManagedRisk` retains its entry flag, risk manager, and callback log between
bars. Its `on_start` installs B's stop and initializes the portfolio's high
water mark. On each callback it passes the broker's current marked equity and
positions to `RiskManager.update`. That call may queue a reduction for the next
bar. The log prints the manager's reported action and the broker's pending
orders separately: a repeated breach can report `reduce` without submitting
another order.

## Read the event order

1. On January 3, the queued entries fill and the strategy observes 16 A and 4 B.
2. On January 4, the new $94 B bar triggers its stop. The engine fills that
   stop before calling the strategy. The callback therefore sees only A and
   $2,156 equity, a 13.8% drawdown from $2,500. It queues a sell for half of
   A's 16 shares.
3. On January 5, the queued reduction fills at $80 before the callback. Gross
   exposure drops from $1,280 to $640. The drawdown remains above 10%, so the
   manager reports a breach but does not queue a duplicate reduction.
4. On January 6, A reaches $120 and equity rises to $2,476. This clears the
   drawdown breach and allows a later risk event.
5. On January 7, A returns to $80. The new breach queues a four-share sell,
   half of the eight shares then held. The January 8 fill leaves four shares
   and $320 gross exposure.

The risk manager stores whether a continuous breach has already caused a
reduction. The strategy retains whether it has submitted the initial orders.
Neither decision can be reconstructed safely from a precomputed vector of
entry signals alone. Inspect fill `exit_reason_detail` and portfolio-state
rows to separate the stop exit, queued reductions, and changes in exposure.
The [Risk Management](../user-guide/risk-management.md) guide covers the rules
and the [stateful strategy examples](https://github.com/ml4t/backtest/blob/main/examples/stateful_strategies.py)
show other uses of callback state.
