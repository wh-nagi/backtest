# Results & Analysis

The [result export tutorial](../tutorials/results-and-analysis.md) joins a
time-zone-aware feed to fills, equity, predictions, and funding, then checks a
Parquet round trip. The [diagnostic handoff](../tutorials/diagnostic-handoff.md)
uses the optional analysis package.

`Engine.run()` returns a `BacktestResult` containing trades, equity curve, fills,
portfolio state, and computed metrics. Everything is accessible as Python objects,
Polars DataFrames, or Parquet files.

The `trades`, `fills`, `equity_curve`, `portfolio_state`, and `rejected_orders` lists are
snapshots: adding to or removing from engine or broker state after `run()` does not change a
completed result.

This applies to both classic OHLCV backtests and quote-aware backtests. When you run
with bid/ask-aware execution or marking, the result surface preserves the quote
context used to produce fills and trade summaries.

For reproducibility, `BacktestResult` also exposes:

- `result.config.to_dict()` for the fully resolved replayable config payload
- `result.to_spec_dict()` for a richer runtime snapshot including library version and realized window
- `result.to_predictions_dataframe()` for the raw prediction/input surface passed into the
  backtest, when available
- `result.rejected_orders` and `result.to_rejected_orders_dataframe()` for orders that reached
  the rejected terminal state
- `result.to_parquet(...)`, which writes `config.yaml`, `spec.yaml`, and `predictions.parquet`
  when available

Snippets using `result` assume an existing `BacktestResult` from `Engine.run()`. The linked export tutorial supplies the complete run and checks each exported table.

### Reporting Model

`BacktestResult` now exposes three distinct raw reporting surfaces:

- `trades`: realized exit legs plus end-of-backtest open-position marks
- `fills`: execution blotter rows
- `portfolio_state`: end-of-bar portfolio snapshots

For rebalancing strategies, `num_trades` is not the right proxy for trading activity.
Use `num_fills`, `num_rebalance_events`, and `total_filled_notional` instead.

Turnover uses a one-way execution-based definition:

```python
turnover_t = filled_notional_at_timestamp / equity_at_timestamp
```

Bars with no fills contribute `0`. This means:

- buying a fully cash portfolio into a fully invested book is turnover `1.0`
- selling a fully invested book back to cash is turnover `1.0`
- fully rotating one full book into another is turnover `2.0`

### Cost Decomposition

Every trade carries a full cost breakdown, letting you separate strategy edge from execution costs:

```python
for trade in result.trades:
    print(f"{trade.symbol}: gross={trade.gross_pnl:+.2f}, "
          f"net={trade.pnl:+.2f}, drag={trade.cost_drag:.4%}")
```

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `trade.gross_pnl` | Price-move P&L: `(exit - entry) * qty * multiplier` |
| `trade.pnl` | Net P&L after all costs |
| `trade.gross_return` | Direction-aware gross return (same as `pnl_percent`) |
| `trade.net_return` | Direction-aware net return including fees |
| `trade.total_slippage_cost` | Entry + exit slippage in dollars |
| `trade.cost_drag` | Total cost as fraction of notional |
| `trade.fees` | Total commission (entry + exit) |
| `trade.entry_slippage` | Per-unit slippage on entry |
| `trade.exit_slippage` | Per-unit slippage on exit |
| `trade.multiplier` | Contract multiplier (1.0 for equities, 50.0 for ES futures) |

Trade records also summarize nullable quote context for the entry and exit:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `trade.entry_quote_mid_price` / `trade.exit_quote_mid_price` | Quote midpoint at fill time |
| `trade.entry_bid_price` / `trade.exit_bid_price` | Best bid at fill time |
| `trade.entry_ask_price` / `trade.exit_ask_price` | Best ask at fill time |
| `trade.entry_spread` / `trade.exit_spread` | Bid/ask spread at fill time |
| `trade.entry_available_size` / `trade.exit_available_size` | Side-aware available quote size |

`pnl_percent` is direction-aware: positive means profitable for both long and short trades.

Quote-aware backtests therefore leave an explicit audit trail:

- fills record the reference price, bid, ask, midpoint, spread, and available size
- trades summarize entry/exit quote context
- portfolio state reflects the configured `mark_price`

## Trade Analyzer

`result.trade_analyzer` computes P&L statistics from realized exit legs, including partial
reductions. Holding-period and MAE/MFE statistics use fully closed position lifecycles. Those
lifecycle values are `NaN` when partial realizations exist but no position has fully closed.

```python
ta = result.trade_analyzer

# Standard metrics
print(f"Win Rate:           {ta.win_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Profit Factor:      {ta.profit_factor:.2f}")
print(f"Avg MFE:            {ta.avg_mfe:.4f}")
print(f"MFE Capture:        {ta.mfe_capture_ratio:.2f}")

# Cost decomposition
print(f"Gross P&L:          ${ta.total_gross_pnl:.2f}")
print(f"Net Profit:         ${ta.net_profit:.2f}")
print(f"Total Costs:        ${ta.total_costs:.2f}")
print(f"Avg Cost Drag:      {ta.avg_cost_drag:.4%}")
print(f"Gross Profit Factor:{ta.gross_profit_factor:.2f}")

# Filter by side
long_stats = ta.by_side("long")
short_stats = ta.by_side("short")
print(f"Long win rate: {long_stats.win_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Short win rate: {short_stats.win_rate:.1%}")

# Export all stats
stats_dict = ta.to_dict()
```

## Trades DataFrame

```python
trades_df = result.to_trades_dataframe()
print(trades_df.head())
```

Returns a Polars DataFrame with columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `symbol` | String | Asset identifier |
| `entry_time` | Datetime | Entry timestamp |
| `exit_time` | Datetime | Exit timestamp |
| `entry_price` | Float | Entry fill price |
| `exit_price` | Float | Exit fill price |
| `quantity` | Float | Position size (negative for shorts) |
| `direction` | String | "long" or "short" |
| `pnl` | Float | Net P&L after costs |
| `pnl_percent` | Float | Direction-aware percentage return |
| `bars_held` | Int | Holding period |
| `fees` | Float | Total commission |
| `exit_slippage` | Float | Exit slippage |
| `mfe` | Float | Maximum favorable excursion |
| `mae` | Float | Maximum adverse excursion |
| `entry_slippage` | Float | Per-unit slippage on entry |
| `multiplier` | Float | Contract multiplier (futures) |
| `entry_quote_mid_price` | Float | Entry quote midpoint |
| `entry_bid_price` | Float | Entry best bid |
| `entry_ask_price` | Float | Entry best ask |
| `entry_spread` | Float | Entry spread |
| `entry_available_size` | Float | Entry-side available size |
| `exit_quote_mid_price` | Float | Exit quote midpoint |
| `exit_bid_price` | Float | Exit best bid |
| `exit_ask_price` | Float | Exit best ask |
| `exit_spread` | Float | Exit spread |
| `exit_available_size` | Float | Exit-side available size |
| `gross_pnl` | Float | Price-move P&L before fees |
| `net_return` | Float | Direction-aware net return including fees |
| `total_slippage_cost` | Float | Entry + exit slippage in dollars |
| `cost_drag` | Float | Total cost as fraction of notional |
| `exit_reason` | String | Why the trade exited |
| `exit_reason_detail` | String | Detailed risk or liquidation cause, when available |
| `status` | String | "closed", "partial", or "open" |

Partial reductions use `status="partial"`. Realized-P&L metrics include partial and fully closed
records, while holding-period and excursion metrics use only fully closed records to avoid counting
one position lifecycle more than once. Open positions at the end of the backtest use `status="open"`
and mark-to-market values.

## Equity DataFrame

```python
equity_df = result.to_equity_dataframe()
print(equity_df.head())
```

Returns a Polars DataFrame with columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | Datetime | Bar timestamp |
| `equity` | Float | Portfolio value |
| `return` | Float | Bar-to-bar return |
| `cumulative_return` | Float | Cumulative return from start |
| `drawdown` | Float | Current drawdown from HWM |
| `high_water_mark` | Float | Running maximum equity |

## Portfolio State DataFrame

```python
portfolio_df = result.to_portfolio_state_dataframe()
print(portfolio_df.head())
```

Returns a Polars DataFrame with columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | Datetime | Bar timestamp |
| `equity` | Float | Portfolio equity after bar processing |
| `cash` | Float | Cash balance |
| `gross_exposure` | Float | Sum of absolute marked position values |
| `net_exposure` | Float | Signed sum of marked position values |
| `open_positions` | Int | Number of open positions |

This is the right primitive for downstream diagnostics such as:

- average invested fraction
- gross and net exposure analysis
- time in market
- occupancy and utilization metrics

## Predictions DataFrame

If you passed `signals_df` into `DataFeed` or `run_backtest(...)`, the raw input
is available on the result:

```python
predictions_df = result.to_predictions_dataframe()
print(predictions_df.head())
```

This returns the original Polars DataFrame without reinterpretation. It is meant
for downstream diagnostics and attribution, for example:

- joining predictions to fills or trades
- evaluating score distributions for winning vs losing trades
- comparing model inputs to realized execution and PnL

The important convention is that this surface is treated as the raw model/input
surface, not as a guaranteed post-mapping trading signal surface.

## Fills

Access every individual order fill:

```python
for fill in result.fills:
    print(f"{fill.asset}: {fill.quantity} @ ${fill.price:.2f}")
    print(f"  Type: {fill.order_type}")
    print(f"  Commission: ${fill.commission:.2f}")
    print(f"  Slippage: ${fill.slippage:.4f}")
```

Or convert them directly to a Polars DataFrame:

```python
fills_df = result.to_fills_dataframe()
print(fills_df.select(["asset", "side", "price", "price_source", "bid_price", "ask_price"]))
```

Fill objects carry order-type metadata for audit:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `fill.order_type` | `"market"`, `"limit"`, or `"stop"` |
| `fill.limit_price` | Limit price (for limit orders) |
| `fill.stop_price` | Stop price (for stop orders) |
| `fill.price` | Actual fill price |
| `fill.commission` | Commission charged |
| `fill.slippage` | Slippage applied |
| `fill.price_source` | Configured source used for the fill |
| `fill.reference_price` | Feed reference price (`bar["price"]`) |
| `fill.quote_mid_price` | Quote midpoint at fill time |
| `fill.bid_price` / `fill.ask_price` | Best bid / ask |
| `fill.spread` | Bid-ask spread |
| `fill.bid_size` / `fill.ask_size` | Quote sizes |
| `fill.available_size` | Side-aware size used for the fill context |
| `fill.exit_reason` | Typed exit category; empty for entry fills |
| `fill.exit_reason_detail` | Detailed risk or liquidation cause, when available |

For quote-aware backtests, `fills.parquet` is the first place to look when you want
to verify whether a result difference came from:

- quote-side execution
- synthetic slippage
- commission
- the configured mark source

## Dictionary Output

For backward compatibility:

```python
result_dict = result.to_dict()
# Same structure as result.metrics
```

## Parquet Export

Save results for later analysis or integration with ml4t-diagnostic:

```python
# Export all result components to Parquet / JSON / YAML
result.to_parquet("./results/my_backtest")
# Creates:
#   trades.parquet
#   fills.parquet
#   rejected_orders.parquet
#   predictions.parquet  # if raw prediction inputs were supplied
#   equity.parquet
#   portfolio_state.parquet
#   daily_pnl.parquet
#   metrics.json
#   config.yaml  # when config is attached
#   spec.yaml  # when config is attached
#   manifest.json

# Reload later
from ml4t.backtest.result import BacktestResult
result = BacktestResult.from_parquet("./results/my_backtest")
```

`manifest.json` identifies artifact schema version 2 and every component written. Loading is
strict by default. An empty directory, missing manifest or required component, interrupted write,
malformed file, or unsupported schema version raises a specific `ArtifactError` subclass before a
result is returned. Selective exports are valid component exports, but they are not complete result
artifacts unless they contain all required components. Schema 1 was an unreleased development
format whose metrics used non-standard bare JSON constants for `NaN` and infinity; current readers
reject it rather than silently changing metric types. The stored `daily_pnl` component must decode
and equal the value recomputed from the stored equity curve.

Manifest-free beta artifacts require explicit recovery:

```python
result = BacktestResult.from_parquet("./results/beta_backtest", recovery=True)

for diagnostic in result.artifact_diagnostics:
    print(diagnostic.code, diagnostic.component, diagnostic.message)
```

Recovery reads supported components in a deterministic order and reports every missing, malformed,
or ignored component. Unsupported manifest schema versions still fail because their interpretation
is not defined. Missing `config` or `spec` data raises only when an explicit `include` requests it;
the default export records unavailable optional components in the manifest. A serialization failure
raises `ArtifactWriteError` whether the component came from the default set or an explicit
`include`. Component payloads are serialized before output files are created.
Non-finite metric floats use a tagged JSON object and are restored on load, so `metrics.json`
remains standards-compliant without losing `NaN` or infinity. NumPy arrays and Polars Series are
stored and loaded as JSON lists. The returned path mapping includes `manifest`; passing its keys
back through `include` treats that key as a no-op because the manifest is always written.

## Integration with ml4t-diagnostic

### Portfolio Analysis (Recommended)

The simplest way to bridge backtest results into ml4t-diagnostic is
`portfolio_analysis_from_result()`:

```python
from ml4t.backtest import Engine
from ml4t.diagnostic.integration import portfolio_analysis_from_result

result = engine.run()

# One-liner bridge to ml4t-diagnostic
analysis = portfolio_analysis_from_result(result, calendar="NYSE")

# Compute PortfolioAnalysis summary metrics
stats = analysis.compute_summary_stats()
print(f"Sharpe: {stats.sharpe_ratio:.2f}")
print(f"Max DD: {stats.max_drawdown:.2%}")
monthly = analysis.compute_monthly_returns()
```

The helper extracts daily returns via `to_daily_pnl()` and sets
`periods_per_year` from the calendar (252 for NYSE, 365 for crypto, etc.).
If no calendar is passed, it uses the config's calendar.

For richer diagnostics, pass these alongside returns:

- `result.to_trades_dataframe()`
- `result.to_fills_dataframe()`
- `result.to_portfolio_state_dataframe()`

```python
# Crypto backtest
analysis = portfolio_analysis_from_result(result, calendar="crypto")

# With benchmark
analysis = portfolio_analysis_from_result(
    result,
    calendar="NYSE",
    benchmark=spy_returns,  # numpy array or Polars Series
)

# Gross vs net comparison
analysis_gross = portfolio_analysis_from_result(results_gross, calendar="crypto")
analysis_net = portfolio_analysis_from_result(results_net, calendar="crypto")
```

!!! note "Requires ml4t-diagnostic"
    Add `ml4t-diagnostic==0.1.4` for portfolio analysis. The full HTML
    tearsheet also requires the visualization extra:
    `uv add 'ml4t-diagnostic[viz]==0.1.4'`. Backtest imports and runs
    without this optional package.

### Trade Records

Convert trades to TradeRecord format for the diagnostic library:

```python
# Bridge to ml4t-diagnostic
trade_records = result.to_trade_records()

# Or use the bridge function directly
from ml4t.backtest.analytics.bridge import to_trade_records
records = to_trade_records(result.trades)
```

The bridge exports all cost decomposition fields (`gross_pnl`, `net_return`, `total_slippage_cost`, `cost_drag`) for diagnostic analysis.

### Full Tearsheet

Use the diagnostic integration function to build the HTML report from a
complete Backtest result. This example uses the bundled synthetic equity panel
and writes `tearsheet.html` in the current directory.

<!-- ml4t-doc-test: guide-tearsheet -->
```python
from pathlib import Path

import polars as pl
from ml4t.backtest import BacktestConfig, DataFeed, Engine
from ml4t.backtest.example_data import ExampleRoundTrip, load_example_prices
from ml4t.diagnostic.integration import generate_tearsheet_from_result

prices = load_example_prices("equity").filter(pl.col("asset") == "AAPL")
result = Engine(
    DataFeed(prices_df=prices),
    ExampleRoundTrip("AAPL", 100),
    BacktestConfig(initial_cash=100_000),
).run()
html = generate_tearsheet_from_result(
    result, title="AAPL example", template="full", output_path="tearsheet.html"
)
assert "<html" in html.lower()
print(f"html_saved={Path('tearsheet.html').is_file()} fills={len(result.fills)}")
```

<!-- ml4t-doc-output: guide-tearsheet -->
```text
html_saved=True fills=2
```

#### Metrics Keys That Enable Tearsheet Sections

The `metrics` dict controls which tearsheet sections render. Sections gracefully degrade when keys are missing.

| Section | Required Metrics Keys |
|---------|----------------------|
| Executive Summary | `sharpe_ratio`, `max_drawdown`, `win_rate`, `profit_factor`, `n_trades`, `cagr`, `volatility`, `expectancy` |
| Cost Attribution | `gross_pnl`, `commission`, `slippage` |
| Statistical Validity (DSR) | `dsr_probability`, `dsr_significant`, `min_trl`, `current_trl`, `trl_sufficient` |
| RAS Adjustment | `ras_adjusted_ic`, `ras_significant`, `original_ic`, `rademacher_complexity` |
| Confidence Intervals | `sharpe_ratio`, `sharpe_ratio_lower_95`, `sharpe_ratio_upper_95` (similarly for other metrics) |
| Haircut Sharpe | `sharpe`, `n_periods` or `n_observations` |
| Expected Max Sharpe | `expected_max_sharpe` |

Sections that depend only on `trades` (trade analysis, MFE/MAE, exit reasons) or `returns` (drawdown, monthly heatmap, rolling Sharpe) require no special metrics keys.

## Config Preservation

The config used for the backtest is preserved in the result:

```python
print(result.config.describe())
print(result.config.preset_name)
```

## In the book

Chapter 16, Section 16.5, [Performance reporting](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading/blob/2d6e8f95eeccaee66906245606471f570b5807e5/16_strategy_simulation/09_performance_reporting.ipynb) develops return and drawdown interpretation. This page defines the result frames and artifact format used to reproduce those reports.
