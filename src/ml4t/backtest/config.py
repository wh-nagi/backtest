Backtest Configuration

Centralized configuration for all backtesting behavior. This allows:
1. Consistent behavior across all backtests
2. Easy replication of other frameworks (Backtrader, VectorBT, Zipline)
3. Clear documentation of all configurable behaviors
4. No code changes needed - just swap configuration files

Usage:
    from ml4t.backtest import BacktestConfig

    # Load default config
    config = BacktestConfig()

    # Load preset (e.g., backtrader-compatible)
    config = BacktestConfig.from_preset("backtrader")

    # Load from file
    config = BacktestConfig.from_yaml("my_config.yaml")

    incrementally as each fill settles.
