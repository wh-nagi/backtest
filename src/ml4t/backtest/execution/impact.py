    and holds no reference to earlier slices of the same parent, so there is
    nothing for a permanent component to persist into. A ``permanent_fraction``
    field was accepted and documented here until 0.1.7 and was never read; it is
    removed rather than defaulted so that asking for a permanent component
    raises instead of silently returning a fully temporary one.
